🎉 **TESTING OPPORTUNITY: IOPPS Platform** 🎉

I'm looking for help testing the new Indigenous Opportunities & Partnerships Platform (IOPPS)!

**What is IOPPS?**
A platform connecting Indigenous job seekers with employment opportunities and helping employers reach Indigenous talent.

**What I need help testing:**
✅ Web app - Employer job posting feature
✅ Mobile app - Job browsing and quick apply
✅ Cross-platform sync - Jobs posted on web appear in mobile

**How to participate:**
📱 MOBILE: Download "Expo Go" from App Store/Google Play, then scan my QR code (I'll share it!)
💻 WEB: Visit https://iopps.ca and create an employer account

**Important:**
⚠️ This is TEST MODE - no real payments!
🎯 Looking for feedback on bugs, UI/UX, and suggestions
⏱️ Takes about 10-15 minutes

**Interested?** Comment below or DM me and I'll send you:
- QR code for mobile app
- Testing guide with scenarios
- My contact for reporting feedback

Thanks for helping make this better! 🙏
